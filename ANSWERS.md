      More direct control over lifecycle methods but other than that it comes down to personal preference.

      componentDidMount = Inital state before inital render. componentDidUpdate = Invoked right after changes occur involving state or props, componentWillUnmount = Invoked after component is unmounted. Used for cleanup.
- [ ] What is the purpose of a custom hook?
      Dynamically use hooks for various components.

      To get a more critical analysis of our code without margin of human error.
